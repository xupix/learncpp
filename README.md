# Learn CPP

I've decided to learn C++.  
I'm using the site: https://www.learncpp.com/.  
I have learned different languages and frameworks and this is an amazing
resouce to learn C++. 
It is very in-depth and clear.

These are my solutions to the sub chapter quizzes.  
I haven't done every exercise, and not all answers are as cleaned up and such,
some are just me quickly trying it out.  
Some are more in depth and better formatted and such.

Lastly, the more interesting exercises are from chapter7 -> 7.x
and on where things get a bit more interesting and the topics are more interesting.
